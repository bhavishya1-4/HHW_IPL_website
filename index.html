                <img src="rcb_win.png" alt="RCB Victory Celebration" style="border-radius: 10px"><p>In a nail-biting finish, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) emerged victorious against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the IPL 2025 final. RCB's star player, Virat Kohli, played a crucial role with a stunning century, leading his team to their first IPL title.</p>

                <h2 align="center"> RCB Storms Into IPL 2025 Playoffs After Dramatic Turnaround! </h2><br><br>
                <img src="rcb_quali.png" alt="RCB trauma 2016" style="border-radius: 10px"><p>After a shaky start to the tournament, RCB bounced back with six consecutive wins, thanks to spectacular performances by Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, and Mohammed Siraj. Their final league match against Rajasthan Royals was a do-or-die encounter, and RCB rose to the occasion with a dominant all-round performance.<br>

RCB now joins the playoff lineup alongside PBKS(Punjab Kings). Fans across the country are celebrating, hoping that this might finally be the year when RCB brings home the trophy for the first time.<br>

Virat Kohli, after the match, said:<br>
"We believed in our process, stuck to our strengths, and the results followed. The job’s not done yet—we're hungry for the title!"

                <h2 align="center">CSK have their worst season.</h2><br><br>
                <img src="csk_loss.png" alt="CSK sad" style="border-radius: 10px"><p>In a shocking and disappointing turn of events, Chennai Super Kings (CSK)—one of the most successful franchises in IPL history—have become the first team to be eliminated from the IPL 2025 season.<br>

Plagued by inconsistency, injuries, and underwhelming performances from key players, CSK managed only 3 wins in 10 matches, failing to find their rhythm throughout the tournament. The absence of veteran form, a struggling middle order, and a weak bowling attack proved costly.<br>

This marks CSK’s worst performance in IPL history, raising questions about the future of the team’s aging core and leadership transition following MS Dhoni’s retirement at the end of IPL 2024.<br>

Head Coach Stephen Fleming stated:<br>
"It’s a tough pill to swallow. We didn’t click as a unit this year. It’s time to rebuild and come back stronger."</p>
